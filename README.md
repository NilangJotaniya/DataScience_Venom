## 🚀 Projects Overview

### 🧼 Data Cleaning
- **Outlier Removal**: Scripts to remove statistical outliers and handle missing data from CSV datasets using pandas and IQR/Z-score methods.

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visual and statistical insights into datasets before modeling.

### 🤖 Machine Learning (ML)
- Basic ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) with scikit-learn.
- Data preprocessing, model training, evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.).

### 🗣 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text classification (e.g., spam detection).
- Tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF, and model building.

### 🌐 Web Scraping
- Extract headlines or weather info using BeautifulSoup and requests.
- Focus on minimal scraping for quick demos.
